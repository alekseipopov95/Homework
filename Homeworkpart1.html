   <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>

<h5>ACT 1</h5>

<h5>PROLOGUE</h5>


<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,</p>
<p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,</p>
<p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,</p>
<p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.</p>
<p>From forth the fatal loins of these two foes</p>
<p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;</p>
<p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows</p>
<p>Do with their death bury their parents' strife.</p>
<p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,</p>
<p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,</p>
<p>Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,</p>
<p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;</p>
<p>The which if you with patient ears attend,</p>
<p>What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

<h5>SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</h5>


<i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i>

<h5>SAMPSON</h5>


Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

<h5>GREGORY</h5>


No, for then we should be colliers.
